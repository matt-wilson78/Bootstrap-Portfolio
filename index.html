            I have spent the majority of my professional career working in sales. I began with a company called Gatelinx, selling DirecTV equipment and services.
            After 2 years with the company, I began a 14 year career with The Pilot newspaper in Southern Pines, North Carolina. I began working in classified advertising sales, and eventually moved to their directory division.
            We published two phonebooks in Moore County, NC and Lee County, NC. As time has passed, print sales have declined, and The Pilot realized they needed a Digital Division to remain competitive.

            Over the last several years, I have worked to teach myself HTML and CSS to make myself more valuable as we grow our Digital Division.
            Within this division, I am responsible for "building" and maintaining our Wordpress websites. We are using Wordpress as a placeholder system while I pursue further education in HTML, CSS, and Javascript through the UNC Coding Bootcamp.
            As I learn more, our plan is to move away from Wordpress, and offer a more versatile web development platform.
